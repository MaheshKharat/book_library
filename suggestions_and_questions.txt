  Add Authentication Layer

  By using authentication you can authenticate user for each request.

  Process for Authenticate user

  We will add new api in it that is /auth

  1. We will create JWT token while user login/register.
  2. And for every request user should sent that JWT token in headers to the server.
  3. By using that token we will be able to authenticate that user.

  I would suggest Jwt token or itsdangerous packages for achiving authenticate user.
